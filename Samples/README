Technical info

48khz24bit

Some other general info:
This piano has been optimized and only properly tested for linuxsampler.
If you want to optimize the .sfz yourself, values of interest are:
-amp_veltrack (dynamics, %)
-ampeg_release (note release decay, seconds)
-The volume(in dB) on the pedal noise is located on the bottom of the .sfz file under //pedalAction
[!] I suggest you make a backup of the .sfz file before you start fiddling with it :)
In the time of writing, sfz for linuxsampler has not come out of cvs. So, it's still a bit of a pain to get this paino going,
and pedalAction noises aren't played either. However, you can load just the pedalAction section in a separate file
in the original free sfz player which you can host with dssi-vst.

Changlog:
* Re-exported all notes with all lowcut filters removed and eased off some eq on some notes around C4
* Replaced all pedal noise samples, there are now two down and two up samples.
* Increased ampeg_veltrack on release harmonics from A0 to C2
* Increased ampeg_release to 0.850
* Introduced a 44.1khz16bit and an ogg vorbis version
